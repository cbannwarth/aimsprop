Description:

A repository for the representation and manipulation of AIMS-type trajectories,
particularly for use in computing time-dependent properties (bond lengths,
angles, torsions, X-ray scattering, UED, photoelectron, UV-Vis, etc) in a
semi-uniform manner.

Directories:

prop - the Python AIMS trajectory/property code
notes - notes used in implementing
