Description:

A repository for the representation and manipulation of AIMS-type trajectories,
particularly for use in computing time-dependent properties (bond lengths,
angles, torsions, X-ray scattering, UED, photoelectron, UV-Vis, etc) in a
semi-uniform manner.

Directories:

aimsprop - the Python AIMS trajectory/property code
notes - notes used in implementing
examples - examples of use cases of property computations
util - utility scripts for common ops like plotting absorption spectra,
    generating difference densities from Molden files, etc (no warrenty on
    these - the usual workflow is to copy these into your own project
    directories and modify until they work)
