# Convert from Amber restart to Geometry.dat file for AIMS

Written by Ruibin Liang

This script converts from Amber restart format to AIMS Geometry.dat files. It assumes your restart file has velocities.

To use, simply change the instances of "coors.rst" and relevant automatic renaming to suit your needs. For AIMS trajectories, your final file _must_ be named Geometry.dat in the submit folder.
